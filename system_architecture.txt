# TRADE System Architecture

## Overview

The TRADE system is designed as a modular, event-driven trading platform for cryptocurrency markets. The architecture follows clean separation of concerns, with each component responsible for a specific aspect of the trading system.

## Core Components

### 1. Market Data Management

- **MarketData** (market_data.py): Stores and manages market price and volume data in memory, providing access to historical data for analysis.
- **MarketMetricsCalculator** (market_metrics.py): Calculates various market metrics such as volatility, relative strength, trend strength, and order imbalance.
- **DataStorage** (data_storage.py): Handles persistent storage of market data for later analysis and backtesting.

### 2. Market Connectivity

- **MarketWebSocketManager** (websocket_manager.py): Manages WebSocket connections to cryptocurrency exchanges, handling connection lifecycle, reconnection logic, and message processing.
- **MarketSimulator** (simulator.py): Simulates market data from recorded datasets for testing and backtesting.

### 3. Analysis and Signal Generation

- **MarketAnalyzer** (market_analyzer.py): Coordinates the analysis process, connecting market data, metrics calculation, and signal generation.
- **SignalGenerator** (signal_generator.py): Generates trading signals based on market conditions and configured strategies.

### 4. Trading Management

- **TradeManager** (trade_manager.py): Manages trade execution, position sizing, and trade lifecycle.
- **ActiveTrade** (active_trade.py): Represents and tracks the current active trade.
- **PerformanceTracker** (performance_tracker.py): Tracks and analyzes trading performance metrics.
- **TradeJournal** (trade_journal.py): Records detailed trade information for later analysis.

### 5. Reporting and Monitoring

- **MarketStatusReporter** (status_reporter.py): Provides regular status updates on market conditions and trading performance.

### 6. Event System

- **EventEmitter** (event_emitter.py): Implements the publish-subscribe pattern for system-wide event handling.
- **Event** (event.py): Represents events within the system.
- **EventType** (event_type.py): Defines the types of events that can occur.

### 7. Utilities

- **LoggerSetup** (logger.py): Configures logging for the system.
- **TradingConfig** (config.py): Manages configuration settings for the trading system.

## Data Flow

1. **Market Data Ingestion**:
   - WebSocket connections receive real-time market data
   - Data is normalized and passed to the MarketAnalyzer

2. **Analysis Pipeline**:
   - MarketData stores the incoming data
   - MarketMetricsCalculator computes metrics from the data
   - SignalGenerator evaluates market conditions and generates signals

3. **Trading Execution**:
   - TradeManager receives signals and executes trades
   - ActiveTrade tracks the current position
   - PerformanceTracker records performance metrics

4. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - MarketStatusReporter provides regular status updates
   - TradeJournal records detailed trade information
   - EventEmitter distributes events throughout the system

## Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses an event-driven architecture to decouple components:

1. **Event Types**:
   - TICK: New market data received
   - SIGNAL: Trading signal generated
   - TRADE_OPENED: New trade opened
   - TRADE_CLOSED: Existing trade closed
   - STRATEGY_UPDATE: Strategy state changed
   - METRIC_UPDATE: Market metrics updated
   - ERROR: Error occurred
   - CONNECTION: Connection status changed

2. **Event Flow**:
   - Components emit events via the EventEmitter
   - Other components subscribe to relevant events
   - This allows for loose coupling between components

## Thread Safety

The system is designed to be thread-safe:

- Each component uses threading.RLock for thread-safe operations
- WebSocket connections run in separate threads
- Status reporting runs in a background thread
- Critical sections are protected with locks

## Configuration

The system is configurable through:

- TradingConfig class with default values
- External JSON configuration file
- Command-line arguments

## Extensibility

The modular design allows for easy extension:

- New market metrics can be added to MarketMetricsCalculator
- New signal generation strategies can be implemented in SignalGenerator
- Additional exchange connections can be added to the connectivity package
- New event types can be defined for additional functionality
